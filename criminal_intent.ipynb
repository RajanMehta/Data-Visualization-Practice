            "Checking with the Insurance Medical Information Bureau reveals that all 14 victims had been insured for $1 million each, under \"key man\" policies.\n",
            "The insurance companies were told that the victims were executives of (phony) companies located in Paris, France.\n",
            "This mastermind used homeless people for his purpose, meaning he had to find them again when he was ready to kill them.\n",

            "Wally Stevens comes to Major Case's office, sent by the insurance companies to help recover the missing millions.\n",
            "Certain aspects of Leo's death aren't consistent with the preceding 13 deaths.\n",
            "Goren figures out that Bernard had killed Leo on his own for the extra check, but botched the job because he wasn't the brains part of the scheme.\n",
            "Multiple small patterns are apparent among the other 13 deaths, and one particular pattern occurs in groups of five.\n",
            "Minus Leo and plus the two other intended victims Lofficier identified, the total body count would be 15.\n",
            "This description fits Stevens to a T. Stevens is the third partner who killed Jack Bernard, and the skill set he identified for Goren and Eames is his own!Goren and Eames visit Stevens at his home and confront him.\n",
            "Stevens had unconsciously revealed his own fraud and falsehoods in the multiple small patterns he made throughout these seemingly accidental deaths.\n",
            "If Jack Bernard hadn't made a mess of killing Leo Gergis, those small patterns would never have revealed the deaths as the murders they really were.\n",
            "Within minutes, Eloise bleeds to death from a slashed femoral artery.\n",
            "Goren observes soap on Eloise's hands, indicating that the attacker had waited until Eloise emerged from the stall.\n",
            "Eloise's death wasn't a botched robbery, but a successful murder.\n",
            "The district attorney orders Rodgers to comply with a restraining order barring an autopsy of Eloise's body, and releasing it immediately to her lawyer.\n",
            "Workers pack the body in dry ice and take it to Kennedy Airport, where a private jet is waiting.\n",
            "Three private jets left Kennedy Airport within a two-hour period after Eloise's body was taken there.\n",
            "Eloise had wanted her body cryogenically frozen after her death.\n",
            "Deakins wonders why Jack, who's running for the U.S. Senate, would risk bad publicity over a court fight with his sister about their father's body.\n",

            "The Kittridges had received death threats because Randolph was actively campaigning in support of the Civil Rights Act.\n",
            "The change in the ashtray and a used stick of lip balm were missing afterward.\n",

            "A staffer tells Goren and Eames that the home originally was going to send the body to Scottsdale.\n",

            "The Kittridge family provided its own pathologist to prepare the body for cremation.\n",
            "Goren suggests that if an accomplished man like Spencer died of a presently incurable disease, he'd be worth preserving and bringing back when a cure was found.\n",
            "Goren says there's another form of the disease called Early-Onset Alzheimer's, which strikes its victims in their 30's and 40's.\n",

            "As he is leaving, Goren walks in with some pictures of a body which police had earlier found which matches Banyon's head.\n",
            "The cause of death was a blow to the back of his head.\n",
            "Eames receives a phone call and tells Goren that a fingerprint found on the refrigerator comes back to an heiress missing in Hong Kong since 1985, named Hilary Marsden.\n",
            "She is able to identify them from the pictures, but cannot remember anything about the night she was attacked.\n",
            "The detectives have pulled similar cold cases involving wealthy out-of-towners who were drugged, killed and their homes stripped.\n",
            "They also receive a report from the 27th Precinct about a robbery in which Wes Banyon was suspected, except that Banyon was already dead at the time of the robbery.\n",
            "Goren takes the typewriter tape and begins painstakingly transcribing the letters from it in an effort to find out what Banyon was writing about, as this is what seemed to get him killed.\n",
            "They get a call from someone requesting \"Inspector Goren,\" who turns out to be Bernard reporting Marcel's murder.\n",
            "Nicole got ten years for the murders, whereas Bernard got eight, and got out of jail with the help of smitten heiress Hilary.\n",
            "Goren says that they shouldn't pay attention to the 'evidence' found in Marcel's murder, of the footprints of various male prostitutes, because that is what Bernard wants them to believe.\n",
            "He says that Marcel was killed as punishment for messing up Banyon's murder.\n",

            "She insists that Marcel is responsible for the murders, and that she then killed Marcel.\n",
            "He denies being in contact with Nicole and calls her a natural killer, and says that she would have been a murderer even without meeting Bernard.\n",
            "The detectives hear a scream and rush to find Bernard lying dead on the stairs and Mala hysterical.\n",
